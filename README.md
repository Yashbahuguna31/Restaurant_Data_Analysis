# Resturant Data Analysis

## Introduction
Yelp is a widely-used web and mobile platform that functions as a crowd-sourced local business review site. Users can submit reviews, photos, and tips about businesses, while also browsing information and ratings left by others. In a competitive market like the restaurant industry, understanding the factors that influence business success is crucial for stakeholders. This project leverages the Yelp dataset to investigate the relationship between user engagement (reviews, tips, and check-ins) and business success metrics (review count and ratings) for restaurants.

## Problem Statement
In the competitive restaurant industry, stakeholders must understand the key factors that drive business success. This project explores the relationship between user engagement metrics (reviews, tips, check-ins) and business success metrics (review count, ratings) to provide actionable insights for restaurant owners and managers.

## Research Objectives
1. Sentiment Analysis: Assess the impact of review sentiment on review count and average star rating.
2. User Engagement Correlation: Quantify the correlation between user engagement (reviews, tips, check-ins) and review count/average star rating.
3. Time Trends: Examine trends in user engagement over time.

## Hypotheses
1. User Engagement and Success: Higher levels of user engagement correlate with higher review counts and ratings for restaurants.
2. Sentiment Impact: Positive sentiment in reviews and tips contributes to higher overall ratings and review counts for restaurants.
3. Consistency and Success: Consistent user engagement over time is positively associated with sustained business success for restaurants.

## Analysis and Key Findings

- Total Businesses: 150,000
- Restaurant Businesses: 35,000 (open)
- Success Metrics: Review count and average rating distribution

### Insights:

- **Ratings vs. Review Count:** Higher ratings do not necessarily guarantee a higher review count, and vice versa. Success is not solely determined by these metrics.
  
- **Review Count Insights:** While review count reflects user engagement, it does not necessarily indicate overall customer satisfaction or business performance.

## Detailed Analysis

### Engagement and Ratings

- **Engagement by Rating:** Data shows a general increase in average reviews, check-ins, and tips as ratings improve from 1 to 4 stars, with a decrease in engagement for ratings above 4 stars.
  - **4-Star Ratings:** Restaurants with 4-star ratings exhibit the highest user engagement, showing a strong correlation between mid-level high ratings and increased user interaction.
  - **5-Star Ratings:** The drop in engagement at 5 stars might suggest a saturation point where fewer customers feel compelled to add their reviews, or a scenario where only a small, highly satisfied audience frequents these establishments.

### Correlation Analysis

- **Reviews, Tips, Check-ins:** There is a significant correlation between these forms of user engagement. Higher activity in one area often correlates with higher activity in others.
  - **Strategic Focus:** Restaurants should implement strategies that boost all types of user engagement to enhance overall visibility and customer interaction. Engaging customers through multiple touchpoints can drive more comprehensive feedback and interaction.

### High-rated vs. Low-rated Businesses

- **User Engagement Correlation:** Higher-rated businesses tend to have increased user engagement across reviews, tips, and check-ins. This underscores the importance of maintaining high service and quality standards, as these appear to drive more reviews, check-ins, and tips, which are critical metrics of customer engagement and satisfaction.

### Sentiment Analysis

- **Sentiment and Success:** Reviews and tips often include sentiments such as "useful," "funny," and "cool," which represent user feedback on the quality and impact of the reviews. Higher counts of these sentiments are linked with greater user engagement and satisfaction, contributing to a restaurant's success.

### Elite Users vs. Non-Elite Users

- **Elite User Engagement:** Elite users, despite being fewer in number, contribute significantly more to the total review count compared to non-elite users. Establishing positive relationships with elite users can lead to repeat visits and loyalty. Elite users are often more experienced and trusted by the community, and their reviews can carry more weight and influence.

### Busiest Hours

- **Peak Engagement Times:** The busiest hours for restaurants, based on user engagement, span from 4 PM to 1 AM. This concentration of user engagement during the evening and night hours suggests a higher demand for dining out during these times, driven by factors such as work schedules, social gatherings, and leisure activities.
  - **Operational Optimization:** Knowing the peak hours allows businesses to optimize their staffing levels and resource allocation during these times to ensure efficient operations and quality service delivery.
